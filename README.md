# Parallel Processing for Speeding up a Voice Chatbot with Google Gemini

Previously, I built a voice assistant (chatbot) with Raspberry Pi, Python, and OpenAI ChatGPT API. In this project, I changed it to use Google's Gemini API. This version has been tested on Raspberry Pi 4 model B. The no-LED version of the code (GVA4Pi1_NoLED.py) works on both Raspberry Pi and Windows. 

Following the YouTube video below to learn more about this code:
